## 1\. Distinguishing research types (exploratory vs. confirmatory)

**Task:** Read the following descriptions and classify them as “Exploratory” or “Confirmatory” along with a brief (\<50-word) reasoning.

* **Scenario A:** A researcher analyzes a large dataset of dietary habits and finds that people who eat more blueberries have a lower risk of stroke; they then publish these results as a primary finding.
* **Scenario B:** A scientist publishes a time-stamped plan on the Open Science Framework (OSF) detailing the exact primary endpoint and statistical model they will use for a drug trial before any patients are recruited.
* **Scenario C:** An investigator explores various ways to transform data (e.g., log-transformations, squaring variables) until a p-value falls below 0.05.


## 2\. Abstract autopsy (identifying red flags)

**Task:** Identify the “Red Flags” in the following research summaries along with a brief (\<50-word) reasoning.

* **Abstract 1:** “A study of 12 women showed that a new herbal supplement improved digestion parameters by 30%. No side effects were reported, and we conclude this is an effective GI issue treatment.”
* **Abstract 2:** “Our prospective cohort study found that daily meditation leads to a 15% reduction in heart disease. We recommend mandatory meditation programs in workplaces.”


## 3\. Identifying cognitive biases

**Task:** Match the behavior to the correct fallacy or bias along with a brief (\<50-word) reasoning.

* **Behavior 1:** A researcher finds a cluster of cancer cases in a neighborhood and assumes a local factory must be the cause, ignoring that random events naturally cluster.
* **Behavior 2:** An investigator checks an unexpected result for coding errors but publishes a “significant” result that fits their theory without any additional verification.
