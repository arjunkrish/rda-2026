# Variance, error, and uncertainty | Week 02 Homework assignment

This assignment is designed to help you to understand ways to estimate and
report variation around an estimate.

Write your answers in a separate text docuent (include the figures you
generate), convert to PDF, and submit using [this form](https://forms.gle/977e4vrVshwTyTcK7).


1. Which error bar is almost always the best to use around the mean? Explain.

2. Read the definition of the Central Limit Theorem from a textbook or
Wikipedia, close the source, and write the definition in your own words. Then,
point out the piece of code and the result in the in-class assignment that
supports this theorem.

3. Explain the qualitative difference between Parts 1, 2, and 3 in the in-class
assignment. What's changing from 1-to-2 and 2-to-3 in terms of reflecting
practical data collection and analysis scenarios?

4. Build on Part 3 of the in-class assignment to write code to calculate the
95% confidence interval. Write detailed documentation for each step to explain
the logic.

5. Why do think the prediction interval is larger than the confidence interval.
Explain in your own words. Next, how could we use bootstrapping to calculate the
prediction interval?
