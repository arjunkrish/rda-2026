# Variance, error, and uncertainty | Week 02 In-class assignment

This assignment is designed to help you to execute and understand three ways to
estimate the standard error of the mean.

This prewritten script illustrates three approaches to the standard error of the mean:

* **Part 1** — Formula-based SEM from a single sample
* **Part 2** — Empirical SEM via repeated sampling from a known population
* **Part 3** — Bootstrap SEM from a single sample (no population needed)

Here's what to do:

1. Download the [R script](./02-uncertainty_inclass.R) or [Python script](./02-uncertainty_inclass.py)
2. Load it into your favorite IDE
3. Work with a partner to go through the code, discuss the logic in detail, and add detailed comments along the way
4. Finally, run the code part-by-part and discuss the results.
