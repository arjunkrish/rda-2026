    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nClass presence\nFirst and foremost: If you sincerely engage with the class and put in earnest effort, you will do well.\n\nCreating a psychologically safe environment\nFor learning and betterment to occur, I need everyone’s contribution to ensure that this class (and all its affiliated spaces including Slack) remain a psychologically safe environment where:\n\nIf learners make a mistake, others (me included) will not penalize or think less of them for it, and\nOthers will not resent or humiliate them when they ask for help or information.\n\nI expect everyone to respect and trust each other so that every learner is confident that the group won’t embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up. To sustain this environment, all of us will listen, stay curious, and be honest while staying away from judgment, unsolicited advice-giving, and interrupting.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nConsistent class presence and participation is required to do well in this course, as most activities are based on material presented and worked on in class.\nIf you have a legitimate reason to miss class (job/graduate school/medical school interviews, health/medical needs, or any other life circumstances), please let me know as soon as you can. I will always be willing to work with you to figure out how to accommodate your constraints and how you may make up for any lost time/points if needed. The same goes for meeting assignment deadlines—if you need more time because of extenuating circumstances, keep me posted and I will support you.\nMultiple absences without notice or explanation will result in a reduction of points allocated for attendance. Similarly, not completing assignments (or any other milestones) without notice/explanation will result in reduction of points at the instructor’s discretion.\n\n\n\nCode of conduct\nIn addition to our campus’s official code of conduct, I expect all conduct to serve the singular goal of sustaining a friendly, respectful, supportive, and fun environment where we can do our best work and have a great time doing it.\nExpected behaviors: - Do work that you’re proud of throughout the course - Be supportive of your fellow learners; respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, and differences - Communicate openly & respectfully with everyone in the class - When you ask for help from fellow learners, respect and appreciate their time and effort\nClassroom etiquette: Respectful and responsible behavior is expected at all times, which includes: - Turning your cell phone off - Refraining from non-course-related use of electronic devices - Not interrupting other students - Not using offensive or demeaning language in our discussions\nFlagrant or repeated violations of these expectations may result in ejection from the classroom/session, grade-related penalties, and/or involvement of the university Ombudsperson.\n\nHarassment and discrimination\nI am unequivocally dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). I will not tolerate harassment of colleagues in any form. Behaviors that could be considered discriminatory or harassing, or unwanted sexual attention, will not be tolerated and will be immediately reported to the appropriate CU office (which may include the CU Police Department).\n\n\nDiscussing or raising concerns\nIf you experience, observe, or just want to talk through anything regarding your or anyone else’s safety and well-being, talk to me. I will not tolerate any discrimination or harassment. You can rest assured that you can come to me and I will listen and I will believe. I will support you and advocate for you with everything within my power.\nNote: As a member of the university community, I have the responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination. If you would rather share information about sexual harassment, sexual violence or discrimination to a confidential employee who does not have this reporting responsibility, I recommend the Ombuds Office that offers students a confidential and impartial place to discuss academic and nonacademic concerns.\n\n\nChosen name and pronouns\nAll people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. Many people do not identify with the name on their birth certificate, school ID, or other forms of identification. At the beginning of this class, everyone indicates the name they use and their pronouns.\nIf you would like to change your name and/or gender marker, you can do that through the Registrar (Student Resources). Please advise me at any point if you need to update your name and/or pronouns in my records.\n\n\n\nMental and physical health\nUniversity life, graduate studies, research, living away from home, and personal relationships—any of these can spring formidable challenges to our mental well-being in unsuspecting, surprising ways.\nTo deal with these circumstances, I hope you are able to make time to take care of yourself (socialize remotely, exercise, eat healthy, sleep, blow off steam, etc.). I also hope that when you feel low, when your physical/mental wellness is being put to test, you will talk to a friend, a friendly colleague, or a close family member.\nI also welcome you to talk to me. You can come to me anytime with any challenge you face and I will listen. I will do my best to learn about any issue you have (without any judgment, I promise), keep anything you share confidential, and offer my thoughts based on my experience. It is my wish, duty, and privilege to be of help in any way to ensure your mental (& physical) well-being so that you can get a great education and have a good time doing it.\nFinally, I urge you to take advantage of many resources available on campus to support your health and wellness including the Mental Health Resources at CU.\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nThe Office of Research Education (ORE) provides an Honor Code policy that we will follow. Here’s a key excerpt:\n\nAll ORE PhD programs expect students to adhere to the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity, including completion of individual work as assigned, adherence to department/program requirements and standards and accurate documentation of sources of information and records in classroom and/or laboratory environments. Examples of behavior that violates these standards include academic dishonesty or complicity in such dishonesty, plagiarism (including the undocumented use of internet and web-based information, including GenAI tools like ChatGPT), cheating, illegitimate possession and/or use of examinations, violation of the ethical standards for conducting research, and fabrication or falsification of data and/or official records.\n\nImportant note on plagiarism: In the context of this course, plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: - Directly copying another student’s solutions to in-class or homework problems - Copying materials from online sources, textbooks, or other reference materials without citing those references in your source code or documentation - Having somebody else—or something else like GenAI tools including ChatGPT—do your pre-class work, in-class work, or homework on your behalf\nAny work that is done in collaboration with other students (or GenAI tools) should state this explicitly, and have their names as well as yours listed clearly.\nMore broadly, you should strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard.\n\n\nAccommodations\nIf you have a university-documented learning difficulty or require other accommodations, please provide me with your approval as soon as possible and speak with me about how I can assist you in your learning. If you do not have an approval but have been documented with a learning difficulty or other problems for which you may still require accommodation, please contact CU’s Office of Disability, Access and Inclusion (ODAI) to acquire current documentation."

    "section": "Frequently asked questions",
    "text": "Frequently asked questions\n\nWhy was this course developed?\nAs many parts of biological and biomedical research are becoming data-intensive, typical graduate training involves courses in coding and statistics. However, students face a significant challenge when trying to apply these learnings to novel research questions and complex datasets. This requires knowing:\n\nWhat the practical definitions of various concepts and their relationships are\nWhen and why they are applied in certain situations and not others\nWhat is a robust sequence of actions to take when applying them to data\nHow to judiciously interpret the results\nHow to clearly and transparently communicate the findings\n\nCurrently, most students learn these ideas only by piecing together a mental model of “acceptable/standard/best practices” based on bits of information from mentors, peers, and published papers.\nThis course addresses this challenge by focusing on common misunderstandings and typical errors in statistical data analysis practice, providing a mental toolkit for critical thinking about statistical methods and results.\nWill this course teach me concepts in statistics?\nThere are already plenty of existing courses at CU that teach introductory, intermediate, and advanced statistics. Search the Academic Catalog using “statistics” under Keyword Search to get the full list. Statistics at the level of BMSC 7820 or BIOS 6601 is strongly recommended before taking this course.\nThis is a non-traditional course aimed at discussing what happens—issues that crop up and nuances that become relevant—when ideas from traditional courses are applied to actual research, messy data, and real-world problems.\nWhy is coding (in languages like R or Python) a prerequisite for this course?\nThe goal is to create opportunities for developing strong intuition behind many concepts in data analysis. This course takes the approach of using programming to implement statistical ideas on real/simulated data and observe the results to build intuition behind various concepts.\nIf you would like introductory courses in programming (in R or Python) and statistical analysis, please check out BSBT 6805, MOLB 7900/7910, or BIOS 6642/6682.\nWhat are some specific coding skills I would need for this course?\nYou will be writing code to: - Read in datasets and wrangle them into a convenient format - Call common statistical functions from standard packages/libraries - Implement simulations/tests (random number generation, for/while loops) - Make plots (scatterplot, histograms, boxplots, etc.)\nFor R users: - tidyverse (readr, dplyr, ggplot2) - Calculating summary statistics (mean/median, std-deviation/variance, correlation) - Generating random numbers (runif, rnorm) - Writing for & while loops\nFor Python users: - pandas (data wrangling) - seaborn (data visualization) - numpy (summary statistics, random numbers) - Writing for & while loops\nYou can find recommended free online resources for learning these skills on the course resources page.\nI’m a postdoc (or research staff) and would like to just attend the class—no need for credits. Is that possible?\nYes! I’m open to having postdocs, research/staff scientists, and faculty members audit this course for free. The only things I ask in return are your active engagement in the class and course materials along with providing constructive feedback.\nAre there going to be exams?\nYes! There will be an end-of-term exam."

    "text": "This assignment is designed to help you recognize cognitive biases, evaluate statistical claims, and identify common pitfalls in study design.\nWrite your answers in a separate text docuent, convert to PDF, and submit using this form.\n\n\nTask: Read the following descriptions and classify them as “Exploratory” or “Confirmatory” along with a brief (&lt;50-word) reasoning.\n\nScenario A: A researcher analyzes a large dataset of dietary habits and finds that people who eat more blueberries have a lower risk of stroke; they then publish these results as a primary finding.\nScenario B: A scientist publishes a time-stamped plan on the Open Science Framework (OSF) detailing the exact primary endpoint and statistical model they will use for a drug trial before any patients are recruited.\nScenario C: An investigator explores various ways to transform data (e.g., log-transformations, squaring variables) until a p-value falls below 0.05.\n\n\n\n\nTask: Identify the “Red Flags” in the following research summaries along with a brief (&lt;50-word) reasoning.\n\nAbstract 1: “A study of 12 women showed that a new herbal supplement improved digestion parameters by 30%. No side effects were reported, and we conclude this is an effective GI issue treatment.”\nAbstract 2: “Our prospective cohort study found that daily meditation leads to a 15% reduction in heart disease. We recommend mandatory meditation programs in workplaces.”\n\n\n\n\nTask: Match the behavior to the correct fallacy or bias along with a brief (&lt;50-word) reasoning.\n\nBehavior 1: A researcher finds a cluster of cancer cases in a neighborhood and assumes a local factory must be the cause, ignoring that random events naturally cluster.\nBehavior 2: An investigator checks an unexpected result for coding errors but publishes a “significant” result that fits their theory without any additional verification."
