## Course policies

### Class presence

**First and foremost:** If you sincerely engage with the class and put in earnest effort, you will do well.

#### Creating a psychologically safe environment

For learning and betterment to occur, I need everyone's contribution to ensure that this class (and all its affiliated spaces including Slack) remain a **psychologically safe environment** where:

- If learners make a mistake, others (me included) will not penalize or think less of them for it, and
- Others will not resent or humiliate them when they ask for help or information.

I expect everyone to respect and trust each other so that every learner is confident that the group won't embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up. To sustain this environment, all of us will listen, stay curious, and be honest while staying away from judgment, unsolicited advice-giving, and interrupting.

#### Attendance policy

Consistent class presence and participation is required to do well in this course, as most activities are based on material presented and worked on in class.

**If you have a legitimate reason to miss class** (job/graduate school/medical school interviews, health/medical needs, or any other life circumstances), please let me know as soon as you can. I will always be willing to work with you to figure out how to accommodate your constraints and how you may make up for any lost time/points if needed. The same goes for meeting assignment deadlines—if you need more time because of extenuating circumstances, keep me posted and I will support you.

**Multiple absences without notice or explanation** will result in a reduction of points allocated for attendance. Similarly, not completing assignments (or any other milestones) without notice/explanation will result in reduction of points at the instructor's discretion.

### Code of conduct

In addition to our campus's official code of conduct, I expect all conduct to serve the singular goal of sustaining a friendly, respectful, supportive, and fun environment where we can do our best work and have a great time doing it.

**Expected behaviors:**
- Do work that you're proud of throughout the course
- Be supportive of your fellow learners; respect each other's strengths, weaknesses, and differences
- Communicate openly & respectfully with everyone in the class
- When you ask for help from fellow learners, respect and appreciate their time and effort

**Classroom etiquette:**
Respectful and responsible behavior is expected at all times, which includes:
- Turning your cell phone off
- Refraining from non-course-related use of electronic devices
- Not interrupting other students
- Not using offensive or demeaning language in our discussions

Flagrant or repeated violations of these expectations may result in ejection from the classroom/session, grade-related penalties, and/or involvement of the university Ombudsperson.

#### Harassment and discrimination

I am unequivocally dedicated to providing a **harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). I will not tolerate harassment of colleagues in any form. Behaviors that could be considered discriminatory or harassing, or unwanted sexual attention, will not be tolerated and will be immediately reported to the appropriate CU office (which may include the CU Police Department).

#### Discussing or raising concerns

If you experience, observe, or just want to talk through anything regarding your or anyone else's safety and well-being, talk to me. I will not tolerate any discrimination or harassment. You can rest assured that you can come to me and I will listen and I will believe. I will support you and advocate for you with everything within my power.

**Note:** As a member of the university community, I have the responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination. If you would rather share information about sexual harassment, sexual violence or discrimination to a confidential employee who does not have this reporting responsibility, I recommend the **Ombuds Office** that offers students a confidential and impartial place to discuss academic and nonacademic concerns.

#### Chosen name and pronouns

All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. Many people do not identify with the name on their birth certificate, school ID, or other forms of identification. At the beginning of this class, everyone indicates the name they use and their pronouns. 

If you would like to change your name and/or gender marker, you can do that through the Registrar (Student Resources). Please advise me at any point if you need to update your name and/or pronouns in my records.

### Mental and physical health

University life, graduate studies, research, living away from home, and personal relationships—any of these can spring formidable challenges to our mental well-being in unsuspecting, surprising ways.

To deal with these circumstances, I hope you are able to make time to **take care of yourself** (socialize remotely, exercise, eat healthy, sleep, blow off steam, etc.). I also hope that when you feel low, when your physical/mental wellness is being put to test, you will talk to a friend, a friendly colleague, or a close family member.

I also welcome you to talk to me. You can come to me anytime with any challenge you face and I will listen. I will do my best to learn about any issue you have (without any judgment, I promise), keep anything you share confidential, and offer my thoughts based on my experience. It is my wish, duty, and privilege to be of help in any way to ensure your mental (& physical) well-being so that you can get a great education and have a good time doing it.

Finally, I urge you to take advantage of many resources available on campus to support your health and wellness including the [Mental Health Resources at CU](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/health-and-wellness-center/mental-health).

### Academic honesty

The Office of Research Education (ORE) provides an Honor Code policy that we will follow. Here's a key excerpt:

> All ORE PhD programs expect students to adhere to the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity, including completion of individual work as assigned, adherence to department/program requirements and standards and accurate documentation of sources of information and records in classroom and/or laboratory environments. Examples of behavior that violates these standards include academic dishonesty or complicity in such dishonesty, plagiarism (including the undocumented use of internet and web-based information, including GenAI tools like ChatGPT), cheating, illegitimate possession and/or use of examinations, violation of the ethical standards for conducting research, and fabrication or falsification of data and/or official records.

**Important note on plagiarism:** In the context of this course, plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:
- Directly copying another student's solutions to in-class or homework problems
- Copying materials from online sources, textbooks, or other reference materials without citing those references in your source code or documentation
- Having somebody else—or something else like GenAI tools including ChatGPT—do your pre-class work, in-class work, or homework on your behalf

**Any work that is done in collaboration with other students (or GenAI tools) should state this explicitly**, and have their names as well as yours listed clearly.

More broadly, you should strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard.

### Accommodations

If you have a university-documented learning difficulty or require other accommodations, please provide me with your approval as soon as possible and speak with me about how I can assist you in your learning. If you do not have an approval but have been documented with a learning difficulty or other problems for which you may still require accommodation, please contact [CU's Office of Disability, Access and Inclusion (ODAI)](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/office-of-disability-access-and-inclusion) to acquire current documentation.

## Frequently asked questions

::: {.faq}

**Why was this course developed?**

As many parts of biological and biomedical research are becoming data-intensive, typical graduate training involves courses in coding and statistics. However, students face a significant challenge when trying to apply these learnings to novel research questions and complex datasets. This requires knowing:

1. What the practical definitions of various concepts and their relationships are
2. When and why they are applied in certain situations and not others
3. What is a robust sequence of actions to take when applying them to data
4. How to judiciously interpret the results
5. How to clearly and transparently communicate the findings

Currently, most students learn these ideas only by piecing together a mental model of "acceptable/standard/best practices" based on bits of information from mentors, peers, and published papers.

This course addresses this challenge by focusing on common misunderstandings and typical errors in statistical data analysis practice, providing a mental toolkit for critical thinking about statistical methods and results.

**Will this course teach me concepts in statistics?**

There are already plenty of existing courses at CU that teach introductory, intermediate, and advanced statistics. Search the Academic Catalog using "statistics" under Keyword Search to get the full list. Statistics at the level of **BMSC 7820** or **BIOS 6601** is strongly recommended before taking this course.

This is a non-traditional course aimed at discussing what happens—issues that crop up and nuances that become relevant—when ideas from traditional courses are applied to actual research, messy data, and real-world problems.

**Why is coding (in languages like R or Python) a prerequisite for this course?**

The goal is to create opportunities for developing strong intuition behind many concepts in data analysis. This course takes the approach of using programming to implement statistical ideas on real/simulated data and observe the results to build intuition behind various concepts.

If you would like introductory courses in programming (in R or Python) and statistical analysis, please check out **BSBT 6805**, **MOLB 7900/7910**, or **BIOS 6642/6682**.

**What are some specific coding skills I would need for this course?**

You will be writing code to:
- Read in datasets and wrangle them into a convenient format
- Call common statistical functions from standard packages/libraries
- Implement simulations/tests (random number generation, for/while loops)
- Make plots (scatterplot, histograms, boxplots, etc.)

**For R users:**
- tidyverse (readr, dplyr, ggplot2)
- Calculating summary statistics (mean/median, std-deviation/variance, correlation)
- Generating random numbers (runif, rnorm)
- Writing for & while loops

**For Python users:**
- pandas (data wrangling)
- seaborn (data visualization)
- numpy (summary statistics, random numbers)
- Writing for & while loops

You can find recommended free online resources for learning these skills on the [course resources page](resources/software-setup.md).

**I'm a postdoc (or research staff) and would like to just attend the class—no need for credits. Is that possible?**

Yes! I'm open to having postdocs, research/staff scientists, and faculty members audit this course for free. The only things I ask in return are your active engagement in the class and course materials along with providing constructive feedback.

**Are there going to be exams?**

Yes! There will be an end-of-term exam.
