title: "Preparatory checklists"
---

Important note: This course assumes you have already learned basic statistical
concepts in a traditional way. These preparation checklist contain Stats 101-level
concepts you should be familiar with before each class. If you need to review
any of these concepts, consult your introductory statistics textbook or freely
available online resources before class.

## General prerequisites for the entire course
### **Basic Statistics Knowledge**

* Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
* Probability basics
* Hypothesis testing
* Confidence intervals
* Common statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square)
* Correlation and simple linear regression

### **Basic R or Python Skills**

* Reading and writing data files
* Data manipulation (filtering, summarizing)
* Basic plotting
* Running statistical tests
* Installing packages/libraries


## **How to use this guide**

1. **Before each class**: Scan the concepts listed for that week
2. **Self-check**: Can you define each concept in one sentence?
3. **Quick review**: If anything is unfamiliar, do a brief refresher
4. **Come prepared**: Solid foundations will help us effectively engage in
discussing reinterpretations and nuances

and, if possible, some experience using AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude for
coding or analysis.
